## 3-Week Rotation Cycle
**Week A → Week B → Week C → Week A** (repeats)

## ADHD Management Protocol

### Focus Techniques
1. **Block all notifications** during study blocks
2. **Pomodoro timer**: 25min work, 5min break
3. **Phone in separate room** during study
4. **Single browser tab** only - bookmark distractions for later
5. **Specific research only** for YouTube (no algorithm browsing)

### Distraction Prevention
- Close Discord, social media, messaging apps
- Use website blockers during study time
- Prepare study materials beforehand to avoid context switching

## Sentence Mining Protocol

### Core Principle
Mine sentences with **exactly one unknown element** (i+1 rule)

### Process
1. **Capture**: Screenshot manga panel with unknown word/grammar
2. **OCR**: Extract text using Google Translate app or Yomitan
3. **Card Creation**: 
   - Front: Japanese sentence + manga image
   - Back: Target explanation + English meaning
4. **Context**: Include character name/situation

### Efficiency Rules
- Maximum 5 cards per reading session
- Skip sentences with 2+ unknowns
- Prioritize grammar over vocabulary
- Focus on high-frequency vocabulary (top 6000 words)

### Priority Order
1. Grammar patterns you recognize but can't produce
2. Common verbs/adjectives in unfamiliar conjugations
3. High-frequency vocabulary
4. Field-relevant technical terms

## Progress Metrics (Track Weekly)

### Quantitative Measures
- Anki retention rate (%)
- Bunpro grammar accuracy (%)
- Manga reading speed (pages/hour)
- Technical vocabulary cards added
- WaniKani level progression

### Qualitative Assessments
- Conversation comfort level (1-10)
- Business terminology confidence (1-10)
- Reading comprehension without dictionary (%)

## Resource Integration Strategy

### Primary Tools (Daily Use)
- **Anki**: Vocabulary + sentence mining
- **WaniKani**: Kanji acquisition
- **Bunpro**: Grammar SRS (critical weakness)
- **Bookwalker.jp**: Manga reading + mining

### Secondary Tools (Strategic Use)
- **Shin Kanzen Master N3**: Reference for unclear Bunpro explanations
- **Comprehensible Japanese**: Structured listening input
- **Games**: Weekend immersion rewards after completing targets

### Eliminated/Limited Tools
- **YouTube**: Research only, no algorithm browsing
- **Multiple apps**: Avoid resource switching
- **Physical textbooks**: Reference only when digital explanations insufficient

## Technical Vocabulary Development

### Networking Terms Priority
1. Basic networking: IP address, router, firewall, subnet
2. Cloud computing: AWS services, virtualization, scalability
3. Business communication: presentation terms, meeting vocabulary
4. Problem-solving: troubleshooting, debugging, implementation

### Sources
- Japanese AWS documentation
- Technical bilingual dictionaries
- Business communication guides
- Industry-specific manga/anime

## Review and Adjustment Protocol

### Weekly Review Questions
1. Am I maintaining the fixed routine without resource switching?
2. Are Bunpro grammar scores improving?
3. Is reading speed increasing measurably?
4. Am I avoiding ADHD distraction triggers?

### Monthly Optimization
- Analyze which application week (A/B/C) shows best results
- Adjust technical vocabulary focus based on work needs
- Modify ADHD strategies based on what's working
- Consider increasing difficulty level when current level becomes comfortable

## Success Indicators

### 3-Month Targets
- Consistent daily routine without resource switching
- Bunpro grammar accuracy >80%
- Manga reading speed increased by 25%
- Basic business conversation capability

### 6-Month Targets
- N2 grammar pattern recognition
- Technical presentations in Japanese (basic level)
- Comfortable social conversations
- Reading technical documentation without frequent dictionary use

### 1-Year Target
- Business-level fluency for networking discussions
- Presentation skills for Japanese audiences
- Natural conversational ability in social settings
