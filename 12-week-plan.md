ADHD Management Protocol
Focus Techniques

Block all notifications during study blocks
Pomodoro timer: 25min work, 5min break
Phone in separate room during study
Single browser tab only - bookmark distractions for later
Specific research only for YouTube (no algorithm browsing)

Distraction Prevention

Close Discord, social media, messaging apps
Use website blockers during study time
Prepare study materials beforehand to avoid context switching

Sentence Mining Protocol
Core Principle
Mine sentences with exactly one unknown element (i+1 rule)
Process

Capture: Screenshot manga panel with unknown word/grammar
OCR: Extract text using Google Translate app or Yomitan
Card Creation:

Front: Japanese sentence + manga image
Back: Target explanation + English meaning


Context: Include character name/situation

Efficiency Rules

Maximum 5 cards per reading session
Skip sentences with 2+ unknowns
Prioritize grammar over vocabulary
Focus on high-frequency vocabulary (top 6000 words)

Priority Order

Grammar patterns you recognize but can't produce
Common verbs/adjectives in unfamiliar conjugations
High-frequency vocabulary
Field-relevant technical terms

Resource Integration Strategy
Primary Tools (Daily Use)

Anki: Vocabulary + sentence mining
WaniKani: Kanji acquisition
Bunpro: Grammar SRS (critical weakness)
Bookwalker.jp: Manga reading + mining

Secondary Tools (Strategic Use)

Shin Kanzen Master N3: Reference for unclear Bunpro explanations
Comprehensible Japanese: Structured listening input
Games: Weekend immersion rewards after completing targets

Eliminated/Limited Tools

YouTube: Research only, no algorithm browsing
Multiple apps: Avoid resource switching
Physical textbooks: Reference only when digital explanations insufficient

Technical Vocabulary Development
Networking Terms Priority

Basic networking: IP address, router, firewall, subnet
Cloud computing: AWS services, virtualization, scalability
Business communication: presentation terms, meeting vocabulary
Problem-solving: troubleshooting, debugging, implementation

Sources

Japanese AWS documentation
Technical bilingual dictionaries
Business communication guides
Industry-specific manga/anime
